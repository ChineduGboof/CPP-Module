The zombieHorde() function takes two arguments: an integer N 
representing the number of zombies to create, and a string name 
representing the name to give to each zombie. 
The function creates a new array of N Zombie objects on 
the heap using the new operator. It then loops through the 
array and sets the name of each zombie to the given name 
using the setName() function of the Zombie class. 
Finally, the function returns a pointer to the first element of the array.

The main function first sets the number of zombies to create 
to 5 and the name to give to each zombie to "Horde Zombie". 
It then calls the zombieHorde() function to create the horde, 
and loops through the array of zombies, calling the announce() 
function of each zombie to print its message. Finally, 
the main function deletes the array of zombies using the delete[] 
operator to free the memory allocated on the heap.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to create a horde 
of zombies using dynamic memory allocation, 
and how to properly manage the memory to avoid memory leaks.

This header file defines the Zombie class, which has a 
private _name member variable of type std::string, 
a default constructor, a constructor that takes a 
std::string argument for the zombie name, a destructor, 
and two member functions: setName() to set the zombie name, 
and announce() to print the zombie message.

This implementation defines the member functions of the Zombie class. 
The default constructor does nothing, while the constructor that 
takes a std::string argument sets the _name member variable to the given name. 
The destructor prints a message indicating that the zombie has been destroyed. 
The setName() function sets the _name member variable to the given name, 
and the announce() function prints the zombie message.

Overall, this header file and implementation define the Zombie class 
and its member functions, which can be used 
to create and manage zombies in a program.
