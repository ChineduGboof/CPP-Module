The exercise involves implementing a Base class with a public virtual destructor 
and three empty classes A, B, and C, that publicly inherit from Base. 
The generate() function is implemented to randomly instantiate A, B, or C and 
returns the instance as a Base pointer. The identify(Base* p) function prints 
the actual type of the object pointed to by p, either "A", "B", or "C". 
The identify(Base& p) function also prints the actual type of the object 
pointed to by p, but using a pointer inside this function is forbidden. 
The challenge is to implement the identify() functions without using the std::typeinfo header. 
A program is required to test that everything works as expected.
