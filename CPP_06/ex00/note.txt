This program is a simple converter that can take a string as input
and convert it into various data types such as char, int, float, and double. 
It includes functions for each type of conversion, as well as a
function to print out all of the conversions at once.

Now, let's go over some of the concepts used in this program:

Pseudo literals: A pseudo literal is a special value in C++ that represents a non-finite number 
or a special value that cannot be represented as a regular number. In this program, 
the pseudo literals used are "nan", "nanf", "+inf", "inf", "-inf", "+inff", "inff", and "-inff".

Static casting: Static casting is a type of type conversion in C++. It is used to convert one data 
type into another data type at compile time. In this program, static casting is used 
to convert an integer into a character.

std::atoi: std::atoi is a C++ standard library function that is used to convert a string 
to an integer.

strtof and strtod: strtof and strtod are also standard library functions used to convert a 
string to a float and double, respectively.

nan, inf, inff: "nan" stands for "not a number" and is used to represent undefined or 
unrepresentable values. "inf" stands for "infinity" and represents a value that is 
larger than any finite number. "inff" is a special float representation of "inf" in C++.
