This program is a simple converter that can take a string as input
and convert it into various data types such as char, int, float, and double. 
It includes functions for each type of conversion, as well as a
function to print out all of the conversions at once.

Now, let's go over some of the concepts used in this program:

Pseudo literals: A pseudo literal is a special value in C++ that represents a non-finite number 
or a special value that cannot be represented as a regular number. In this program, 
the pseudo literals used are "nan", "nanf", "+inf", "inf", "-inf", "+inff", "inff", and "-inff".

Static casting: Static casting is a type of type conversion in C++. It is used to convert one data 
type into another data type at compile time. In this program, static casting is used 
to convert an integer into a character.

std::atoi: std::atoi is a C++ standard library function that is used to convert a string 
to an integer.

strtof and strtod: strtof and strtod are also standard library functions used to convert a 
string to a float and double, respectively.

nan, inf, inff: "nan" stands for "not a number" and is used to represent undefined or 
unrepresentable values. "inf" stands for "infinity" and represents a value that is 
larger than any finite number. "inff" is a special float representation of "inf" in C++.

Now that we have covered some of the concepts used in this program, let's go over 
what each function in this program does:

is_pseudo_literal: This function checks if the input string is one of the pseudo 
literals mentioned above.

convert_to_char: This function attempts to convert the input string to a character. 
If the string is a pseudo literal, the function prints out "Impossible". 
If the string cannot be converted to a valid character, the function prints out 
"Non displayable". If the string is a valid character, it is converted and printed out.

convert_to_int: This function converts the input string to an integer. 
If the string is a pseudo literal, the function prints out "Impossible". 
If the string is not a valid integer, the function does not print anything. 
If the string is a valid integer, it is converted and printed out.

convert_to_float: This function converts the input string to a float. 
If the string is a pseudo literal, the function prints out "Impossible". 
If the string is a valid float, it is converted and printed out.

convert_to_double: This function converts the input string to a double. 
If the string is a pseudo literal, the function prints out "Impossible". 
If the string is a valid double, it is converted and printed out.

print_all_convetions: This function calls all of the conversion functions 
and prints out the results.

is_valid: This function checks if the input string is a valid number that can be 
converted to one of the supported data types. It checks for invalid characters 
and checks if the input is a single alphabet character, 
which can be converted to its ASCII value.

In order to replicate this program, you will need to have a good understanding of data types, 
type conversions, and standard library functions in C++. 
You will also need to understand concepts such as pseudo literals, 
nan, inf, inff, and static casting. I recommend studying these concepts 
in detail and practicing using them in code.
