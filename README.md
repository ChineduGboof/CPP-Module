# CPP Module Courses 01 to 08

This repository contains the coursework and projects for the CPP Module Courses 01 to 08. These courses cover a range of fundamental concepts and techniques in C++ programming. Each course builds upon the previous one, gradually expanding your knowledge and skills in C++ development.

## Course Topics

The courses cover the following topics:

1. Namespaces: Learn how to organize code into separate namespaces to prevent naming conflicts and improve code organization.

2. Classes: Understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming by creating classes to encapsulate data and behavior.

3. Member Functions: Explore the concept of member functions within classes and learn how to define and use them.

4. stdio Streams: Gain familiarity with standard input/output streams and how to perform input and output operations in C++.

5. Initialization Lists: Discover the benefits of initialization lists and how to use them to initialize class members.

6. Static and Const: Understand the usage of static and const keywords and their implications in C++ programming.

7. Memory Allocation: Learn about memory allocation and deallocation in C++ using dynamic memory allocation techniques.

8. Pointers to Members and References: Explore the concepts of pointers to members and references and understand their applications in C++.

9. Switch Statement: Master the switch statement and learn how to use it for conditional branching in C++.

10. Ad-hoc Polymorphism and Operator Overloading: Understand the concept of ad-hoc polymorphism and learn how to overload operators for custom types.

11. Orthodox Canonical Class Form: Discover the guidelines for implementing the Orthodox Canonical Class Form to ensure correct behavior and improve code maintainability.

12. Inheritance: Learn about inheritance, a fundamental feature of object-oriented programming, and understand how to create derived classes from base classes.

13. Exceptions: Explore exception handling mechanisms in C++ and learn how to handle and propagate exceptions in your code.

14. Casts: Understand different types of casts in C++ and learn when and how to use them safely.

15. Templates: Discover the power of templates in C++ and learn how to create generic code that can work with multiple types.

16. Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms: Explore the STL (Standard Template Library) and learn how to use templated containers, iterators, and algorithms to manipulate data efficiently.
